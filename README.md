## 🏙️ Overview

**SkillSwap** is a community-driven skill-sharing platform built for the people of Philadelphia.

## 🤝 The Vision

Philadelphia has always thrived on mutual aid — neighbors helping neighbors, community centers feeding families, churches offering shelter, and volunteers stepping up when it matters most.

**SkillSwap** amplifies that spirit by providing a digital space where these actions are recognized, rewarded, and made accessible to everyone.

With SkillSwap, users can:

- 📚 **Share skills**: Offer help in anything from tutoring to home repair.  
- 💰 **Earn tokens**: Get rewarded for your time, knowledge, and effort.  
- 🤝 **Spend tokens**: Use earned tokens when *you* need help.  

It’s a **“give to get”** model — a self-sustaining community exchange.
